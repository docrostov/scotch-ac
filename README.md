# SCOTCHAC -- An Aftercore Module

This script is intended to be an aftercore module for the KOL; it includes a bunch of things I commonly do in aftercore and ways to do it. It also is a way for me to learn JavaScript!

To install (though I don't know why you'd want to), use:

```svn checkout https://github.com/docrostov/scotch-ac/branches/master/KoLmafia```
